  **Task 1:**

  Create 3 separate text files as follows:

  1. Consists of n elements in increasing order in the range (1, 1000).
  2. Consists of n randomly generated numbers in the range (1, 1000).
  3. Consists of n randomly generated numbers in the range (106, 109)

  **Task 2:**

  Write a program on Linear Search for n = 1000000.

  Input array: Read the text file one at a time.

  Key: User input

  **Task 3:**

  Compute the total time for performing Linear search.

  Make a table of results.

  PS: In case you are getting time as 0, then try running q iterations of the program and take the average time.

  Implement a program to do the following:

  Input: An unsorted array of size n (user input) and fill it with random numbers.

  Output: Sorted array 

  Procedure:

  Write three functions separately that the main function calls one after another, where each function sorts the same array using a different algorithm, namely:

  \1. Radix sort

  \2. Bubble sort

  \3. Merge sort

  Experiment: Compute the average runtime for each of the three techniques separately, for n = 10^3, 10^6 and 10^7.

  Upload the code and results in a table.

- ### [Lab 5](https://blackboard.snu.edu.in/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_23293_1&course_id=_3833_1&assign_group_id=&mode=view)

  Implement a recursive algorithm for matrix multiplication for 2 matrices of size 128 X 128. Entries in the matrix should be numbers in the range (0, 9). Measure the time taken by this algorithm. 

  Implement Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication in the same case and compare the performance with the above.

  Submit the codes of both programs and the comparison results. 

- ### [Lab 6](https://blackboard.snu.edu.in/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_23581_1&course_id=_3833_1&assign_group_id=&mode=view)

  Suppose you were to drive from point A to point B. Your gas tank with a capacity C, when full, holds enough gas to travel m miles. You have a precise map that gives distances between gas stations along the route. Let d1 < d2 < …. < dn be the locations of all the gas stations along the route where di is the distance from point A to the gas station. You can assume that the distance between neighboring gas stations is at most m miles.

  In the case that the rate at which you can fill your tank at a gas station is r (in liters/minute), so if you stop to fill your tank from 2 liters to 8 liters, you would have to stop for 6/r minutes. Give the most efficient greedy solution, where you need to minimize the total time you stop for gas filling?
